# fajrulfx.github.io/gerhana
A stupid solution to host eclipse data as an API-like website. Designed to be easily connected with Nightbot for seamless integration in my YouTube livestream.

*Update*: It works!

## Nightbot setting
- Custom command `!gerhana`
- Variable response `$(urlfetch https://fajrulfx.github.io/gerhana/api/$(query).txt)`
